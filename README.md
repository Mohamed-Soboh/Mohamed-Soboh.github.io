We use Beautiful Soup
It is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files.
It creates parse trees that are helpful to extract the data easily.
Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating,
searching, and modifying a parse tree, and it sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib,
allowing users to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.
